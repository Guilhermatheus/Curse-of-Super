# Curse of Super

A simple script that makes all characters start in super form! **With a drawback**, of course...


## What does it do?

Any character, vanilla or modded, even the ones who can't turn super, will start levels and boss fights in this form. But running out of rings will instantly kill them!

To complete levels it's encouraged to collect more rings and go as fast as possible.

With these conditions in mind, some changes were made for power-ups and specific interactions:


### Ring Attraction

By default, any character will attract rings that are close, so the player can balance between speeding and collecting.


### Invincibility Monitor

Acquiring invincibility will stop ring drain until it runs out, hitting enemies in this state also awards you 2 rings.


### More Ring Sources

These are new ring sources that may help in your journey:

- Special Tokens awards 25 rings.
- Speed Shoe Monitors awards 10 rings.

These are to make this challenge possible:

- Hitting bosses awards 5 rings to all players.
- Hitting Metal Sonic awards 7 rings to all players.


## Installation

To install this mod, just drag the ```Curse of Super.lua``` to the mods folder of SRB2 and enable it in the mods menu.


## Compatibility

In general, most mods have compatibility with this one,  mods that affect super form should also work properly.

A very clear problem is custom maps, some have a scarce amount of rings or don't have any at all, being impossible to complete. Take this into account when you're going to play a custom map.


### Sol Form

This mod has compatibility with [RushChars - Blaze and Marine](https://mb.srb2.org/addons/rushchars-blaze-and-marine.3831/)'s Sol forms, characters that have Sol form will enter that form instead of super.


## Inspiração

This mod was inspired by modded character [Super Sonic](https://mb.srb2.org/addons/super-sonic.3234/) and a secret character from [Sonic 1 Forever](https://teamforeveronline.wixsite.com/home/sonic-1-forever), both work in a very similar way.

Although, I felt they needed more moveset options other than Sonic's, then this mod was born!
